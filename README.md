# Want to use some of the code ?
Feel free to use the code as long as you follow the lisence and copywrite agreement.

## Developer Notes
In javascript the functions are made in a connected loop and can be sensitive if deployed to handle heavy applications or heavy data from APIs 
The code is best used for small applications with minimum requirements or if you really need it for heavy work you should look nto tweaking the function renderFullRecipe but do so carefully.
